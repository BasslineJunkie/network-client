# GEO - Project
GEO â€“ is **decentralized `p2p` (or better `f2f`: friend to friend) platform** for economic cooperation between people.


### Quick summary
---
##### GEO Core is the stack of protocols
* for nodes discovering and path(s) finding; `[#todo: add graph traverse approaches description]`
* for payment transactions processing through pair (or several) nodes; `[#todo: add protocol descripion]`
* for cryptographic transactions signing and overall network fraud defence. `[#todo: add protocol descripion]`;

##### Is **not** blockchain-based
Unlike most of nowadays distributed payment systems, GEO does not relays on blockchain technology, and, therefore, is able do independently process dozens of millions of transactions per day. `[#todo: describe why blockchain is limited for tasks like that]` [#todo:add comparison with [Ripple](https://ripple.com) and [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/)]

##### GEO is p2p:
* worldwide availalbe;
* completely decentralized architecture with no supernodes and nodes ranks (*planned*);
* no central point of failure;
* no common-network operations: transactions are balanced between nodes influenced;

##### The problem to be solved by GEO
The problem to be solved by GEO is limiting and destructive influence of the current financial system on the relationships between people. GEO offers an alternative way of economic interaction - the implementation and usage of a decentralized system of trust bonds between people.

### Brief economic model description
---
GEO offers an alternative way of economic interaction - interchange without money using of a decentralized system of trust bonds between people.

Consequences for society that we expect:

- resources of exchange are generated directly by the members of society in accordance with the
economic feasibility, and the excess is automatically deleted from the system as unnecessary

- access to the means of exchange is practically unlimited

- human well-being (enterprises, communities) depends only on the kind of value it creates for society

- effective decentralized and automatic regulation of economic processes (reduction or absence of the
causes of financial crises, inflation, etc.)

##### How to join to the discussion about the economic model
`[#todo: add slack integration]` `[#todo: add email subscription]` `[#todo: open Google docs for commenting and collaborating]`


### Project status
---
##### GEO is a work in progress!
Today, we have the economic model proven by real experiment `[#todo: add info about experiment in CV]`, the mathematic model and centralized implementation `[#todo: describe GEO Pay]`, that is used to improve the economic and algorithmic visions before decentralised protocol will be implemented. In our vision, this way gives us ability to prove our expectations and to move out all hypothesis. 


### How you can join or help
---
You are welcome 
* to join the community `[#todo: add slack integration]`;
* co-writing the economic model `[#todo: add email subscription]` `[#todo: open Google docs for commenting and collaborating]`;
* or support the project by coding the protocol `[#todo: add instructions]`;
