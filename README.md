### What is technology used

At the heart of the system lays a unique mathematical algorithm of the search of links and netting. Technically decentralized system is designed as an innovative p2p system in which computing and protective functions are distributed between user devices, using a minimum of resources. The connection is created between people and forms a single unique public information as well as the identification system.

### What is economic model

GEO offers an alternative way of economic interaction - interchange without money using of a decentralized system of trust bonds between people.

Consequences for society that we expect:

- resources of exchange are generated directly by the members of society in accordance with the
economic feasibility, and the excess is automatically deleted from the system as unnecessary

- access to the means of exchange is practically unlimited

- human well-being (enterprises, communities) depends only on the kind of value it creates for society

- effective decentralized and automatic regulation of economic processes (reduction or absence of the
causes of financial crises, inflation, etc.)
